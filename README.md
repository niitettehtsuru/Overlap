# Lock Down
Lock Down is a game to simulate the practicing of social distancing during this Corona Virus(COVID19) pandemic. 
Hope you enjoy it.  

Explanation
-----------
The yellow node represents a healthy person(you). <br>
The purple nodes represent infected/sick people. <br>
You must navigate from the left wall of the window to the right wall of the window without touching any infected/sick nodes(or the linked lines between sick/infected nodes). 
Failure to do this results in a GAME OVER. <br>
Move across the canvas with your keyboard arrow keys. <br>
Pause the game by pressing the ESC button on your keyboard.
